# RPG Battler - Indev 0.1
This is an attempt to make a simple turn based combat RPG of sorts. This is a project for me to start ReactJS development.

# Dev Notes
- Features to implement
    - Firebase implementation 
        - this will then pave way for leaderboards and character creation
            - consider having a classless system in which players can use any combination of items in order to beat their opponents
    - Fully implement inventory
        - this will pave way for rare items, potions and spells.
    - Daily Theme
        - I want this game to work like wordle, but instead of solving the word, they have a finite amount of mobs they can fight in a day.
